    <p>Waypoint Spine was formed by healthcare providers sharing a common vision.  From this vision, a philosophy has been born, and that philosophy now provides Central Wisconsin with a practice focused entirely on the care of spinal disorders.</p>
    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p>For those suffering with these problems, it is often very painful and usually frightening.  Even worse, many feel they are “given the run around” or “moved through like cattle” when trying to get these issues addressed.</p>
    <p>Phone calls to the doctor’s office often result in multiple transfers and long wait times, often only to leave a message that isn’t returned.  If it’s after hours, a patient might be speaking to someone with little background or knowledge of the spine.</p>
    <!--<p>This is particularly frustrating for surgical patients who need to speak with a well-informed person.</p>-->
    <p>Waypoint Spine provides the necessary time and specialized focus for each patient, so everyone can be treated with the resources that they deserve.  We believe quite strongly that many spinal problems can be treated without the fear, risk, and cost of surgery.</p>
    <p>Under specific circumstances, surgery might become an option.  In these cases, patients should receive care from a surgeon who does <strong><em>only</em></strong> spine surgery.</p>
    <p>In addition, patients will always have access to someone who is knowledgeable and experienced enough to see them through the period before and after surgery.  This will give patients the education, comfort, support, and access that they need for a successful recovery.  Patients can then say, “I’ve come to the right place.”</p>
    <!--<p>This is the philosophy of Waypoint Spine.</p>-->
    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>A waypoint is a reference point that helps us know where we are and where we're going. Whether we are walking, driving, sailing, or flying, waypoints help us find our way.</p>
    <p>Our mission is to be a waypoint for patients with back and neck disorders.  We first establish where we are – by making a clear diagnosis.  In other words, we figure out which body part is causing pain.  Then, we establish where we are going – by developing an understandable treatment plan for each patient.  Typically, we start with conservative options first and then, only if necessary, discuss how surgery may be beneficial.  Throughout the process, we attempt to set reasonable expectations and goals for our patients.</p>
    <h2>Locations</h2>
    <p>Waypoint is the combination of our first two locations in central Wisconsin:  <a href="{{ "/locations/wausau-wi/" | relative_url }}"><strong><em>Wa</em></strong>usau</a> and <a href="{{ "/locations/stevens-point-wi/" | relative_url }}">Stevens <strong><em>Point</em></strong></a>.</p>
