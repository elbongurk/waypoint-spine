    <h2>History</h2>
    <p><a href="{{ "/team/todd-fairchild/" | relative_url }}">Dr. Fairchild</a> founded Waypoint
    Spine in 2016 as a clinic capable of offering both conservative and surgical treatment
    options for spine care. In 2018, <a href="{{ "/team/jason-potocki/" | relative_url }}">Dr. Potocki</a> joined
    Waypoint Spine as a second spine surgeon with a similar philosophy to Dr. Fairchild &mdash; emphasizing
    conservative care first, followed by expert spinal surgery care only if needed.</p>
    
    <p>For those suffering with back and neck problems, it is often very painful and difficult to
    gain a full understanding of the care that may be needed. &ensp;At Waypoint Spine, our specialized
    surgical and therapeutic teams spend the necessary time and focus to ensure that each patient is
    provided with an appropriate and easy-to-understand treatment plan. While spine surgeons oversee
    all treatment plans, our patients will always have access to our full team of physicianâ€™s
    assistants, nurses, physical therapists, and general practitioners.  After conservative methods
    of treatment have been considered, or under specific circumstances, surgery may be
    recommended. </p>

    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <!-- <h5>What is a waypoint?</h5> -->

    <!-- <p>A waypoint is a reference point that helps direct <em>where we are</em> and <em>where we are -->
    <!--   going</em>. Whether we are walking, driving, sailing, or flying, waypoints often help point -->
    <!-- out our path along the way.</p> -->
    <p>What is a &ldquo;waypoint&rdquo;? &ensp;A waypoint is a reference point that helps
    direct <em><strong>where we are</strong></em> and <em><strong>where we are going</strong></em>. Whether we are walking, driving, sailing, or flying, waypoints often help point
    out our path along the way.</p>

    <p>At Waypoint Spine, our mission is to be a waypoint for those with back and neck disorders.
    We first establish <em><strong>where we are</strong></em> by making a clear diagnosis; in other words, we figure out which
    body part is causing pain.  Next, we plan <em><strong>where we are going</strong></em> by
    developing an understandable and customized treatment plan.  In most cases, we begin conservative options
    first, and then &mdash; only if necessary &mdash; our surgeons discuss how surgery may be beneficial.
    Throughout the process, we continue to set reasonable expectations and goals with our
    patients.</p>

    <p><strong>Let Waypoint Spine help you on your journey to a healthy back and
        neck.</strong></p>
