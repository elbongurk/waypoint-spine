    <p>Amy grew up in the Madison area and graduated from the University of Wisconsin – Madison in 1987, receiving a Bachelor’s degree in Exercise Physiology.  She then completed her Master’s degree at the University of Alabama – Birmingham in 1989 in the same field.  With a desire to work in a clinical setting, Amy completed her education in physical therapy at Finch University of Health Sciences/Chicago Medical School in 1994.  Moving to Stevens Point after graduation, Amy worked at St. Michael’s Hospital for over 20 years.  Having treated patients with all types of diagnoses, she developed a strong interest in helping spine patients, such as those with acute and chronic neck and back pain, headaches, and other spine related problems.</p>
    <p>Collaborating regularly with Dr. Fairchild and the other providers, Amy can better assist patients and address their needs in a timely manner that is consistent with the holistic approach of the clinic.  Amy believes that no two patients are the same, even if they have the same diagnosis or have had the same surgery.  Oftentimes spine patients have been through years of pain and failed treatment plans, but with an eclectic approach to treatment, using a variety of manual therapies, dry needling and evidence-based exercise programs, Amy tries to give patients new hope on their journey back to health.</p>
    <p>When she is not working, Amy enjoys traveling, reading, spending time with family and enjoying a variety of outdoor activities.  During the winter months, you can find her in Berg Gym supporting the UWSP Women’s basketball team.</p>
