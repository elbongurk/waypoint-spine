    <p>Waypoint Spine puts safety first against COVID-19 while keeping its Spine Clinic and Physical
    Therapy open to new and current patients.  Please note that if you are symptom free and have an
    appointment at Waypoint Spine, we are screening patients at the doors to our clinic (West doors)
    where patients are provided with a mask.</p>
    <p>We are only seeing one patient at
a time in each clinic, limiting exposure to others.  Patients should
not bring anyone else into the appointment with them during this time.
Thank you for your cooperation in helping Waypoint Spine maintain a
      safe environment.</p>
    <p>If you have symptoms such as a fever or cough, these are
symptoms of COVID-19, and you should call our office at (715) 544-1775
to reschedule your appointment.  If you have such symptoms and think
you may have been exposed to COVID-19, please call your general
healthcare provider.  Additionally, shortness of breath is an
emergency warning sign of COVID-19 and requires immediate medical
attention.  For further information, visit the Center for Disease
      Control (CDC) website at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/">www.cdc.gov</a>.</p>
