    <p>Waypoint Spine providers view surgery as a last resort, but for those patients who do require surgery, our specialist surgeons provide a distinct advantage to their patients by utilizing cutting-edge technology in the surgical suite to help ensure the most safe, efficient, effective, and comfortable surgical experience possible.</p>
    <p>Our experience matters.</p>
    <p>Speaking of experience, Waypoint Spine's surgeon's have over ten years of experience performing surgeries using Medtronic's O-Arm and StealthStation&trade; virtual imaging systems.</p>

    <h2>O-Arm & StealthStation&trade; S8</h2>
    <p>The O-Arm machine is used for complex spinal fusion surgeries. Simply put, it's a CT scan machine that takes a picture while a patient is laying on the operating table and creates a custom 3D image of that patient. All instruments are precisely visualized by the machine's cameras so that one of our specialist surgeons can accurately place hardware using computer guided navigation. This minimizes any injuries that can be caused by misplaced hardware. It can also allow for the use of small incisions for minimally invasive surgeries.</p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 15px;"><strong>ADVANTAGES:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>In place 3D body and tool imaging allowing for computer guided placement of medical hardware in the body.</li>
      <li>Greatly reduces risk of injury due to misplaced hardware.</li>
      <li>System includes over 200 medical instruments that can be paired so providers have the right tool for any job.</li>
      <li>Complete 3D imaging of the body allows providers to precisely visualize the unique anatomy of each patient.</li>
      <li>Providers can view 3D real-time information while performing procedures greatly reducing the risk for injury or complications (rather than having to rely on traditional anatomical landmarks which can vary or in some cases even have been partially or fully removed).</li>
      <li>Numerous published clinical articles demonstrate improved accuracy in pedicle screw placement with navigation.</li>
    </ul>
